    "The environment is a 2D grid world where the agent can move in four directions: up, down, left, and right. There are 3 different types of tiles: \n",
    "- **Empty tiles**: The agent can move freely on these tiles.\n",
    "- **Wall tiles**: The agent cannot move through these tiles.\n",
    "- **Goal tile**: The agent receives a reward of +1 when it reaches this tile.\n",
    "\n",
    "The agent starts at a random position on the grid and must visit all goal tiles, making this a CPP (Coverage Path Planning) problem. The agent receives a reward of +2 for each goal tile it visits and a penalty of -1 for each step it takes to encourage shorter paths."
